Resource Acquisition Is Initialization
The RAII is a widespread programming paradigm, that can be used to protect a resource such as a file stream, a network connection or a block of memory which need proper management.

Acquiring and releasing resources
In most programs of reasonable size, there will be many situations where a certain action at some point will necessitate a proper reaction at another point, such as:

Allocating memory with new or malloc, which must be matched with a call to delete or free.

Opening a file or network connection, which must be closed again after the content has been read or written.

Protecting synchronization primitives such as atomic operations, memory barriers, monitors or critical sections, which must be released to allow other threads to obtain them.

The following table gives a brief overview of some resources and their respective allocation and deallocation calls in C++:
