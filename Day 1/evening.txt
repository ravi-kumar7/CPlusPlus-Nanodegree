Running a new C++ program is normally a two step process:

Compile your code with a compiler.
Run the executable file that the compiler outputs.

main() should return an integer (an int in C++), which indicates if the program exited successfully.

The last bug is a bad joke, because you never get it.

#include <iostream>

The #include is a preprocessor command which is executed before the code is compiled. It searches for the iostream header file and pastes its contents into the program. iostream contains the declarations for the input/output stream objects.
using std::cout;

Namespaces are a way in C++ to group identifiers (names) together. They provide context for identifiers to avoid naming collisions. The std namespace is the namespace used for the standard library.
The using command adds std::cout to the global scope of the program. This way you can use cout in your code instead of having to write std::cout.
cout is an output stream you will use to send output to the notebook or to a terminal, if you are using one.
Note that the second two lines in the example end with a semicolon ;. Coding statements end with a semicolon in C++. The #include statement is a preprocessor command, so it doesn't need one.
cout << "Hello!" << "\n";

In this line, the code is using cout to send output to the notebook. The << operator is the stream insertion operator, and it writes what's on the right side of the operator to the left side. So in this case, "Message here" is written to the output stream cout.

string declaration in c++
std::string b;
b ="a string";
