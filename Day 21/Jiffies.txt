Technically jiffy in computer parlance is the duration of 1 tick of the system timer interrupt. It's not absolute though.
A jiffy is basicly just a unit of time. The more loops the kernel can complete in a "jiffY" the faster your processor is. But since humans work in terms of mhz and ghz, it goes through a series of calculations to convert that number to something more usuable.
The accuracy of various system calls that set timeouts and measure CPU time is limited by the resolution of the software clock, a clock maintained by the kernel which measures time in jiffies. The size of a jiffy is determined by the value of the kernel constant HZ.

The value of HZ varies across kernel versions and hardware platforms.

So basically when Jiffy is combined with HZ it is used to guess your CPU speed.

Please go through this link and then search for /proc/[pid]/stat

and read the corresponding values that are present in the file /proc/<process number>/stat.

Once you go through it you will find there are number of values that are present there which can be used for various purposes.

Since you want to know the ActiveJiffies for a process you will need to look for the values

utime
stime
cutime
cstime
Then jiffies is sum of all these values for a process.
