For Loop with a Container
C++ offers several ways to iterate over containers. One way is to use an index-based loop as above. Another way is using a "range-based loop", which you will see frequently in the rest of this course. See the following code for an example of how this works:

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using std::cout;
using std::vector;
â€‹
int main() {
    // Add your code here.
    vector<int> a {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    for (int i: a) {
        cout << i << "\n";
    }
}

When a function is declared and defined in a single C++ file, the basic syntax is as follows:

return_type FunctionName(parameter_list) {
  // Body of function here.
}
