The first lines that you'll want in your CMakeLists.txt are lines that specifies the minimum versions of cmake and C++ required to build the project. Add the following lines to your CMakeLists.txt and save the file:

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5.1)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)
These lines set the minimum cmake version required to 3.5.1 and set the environment variable CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD so CMake uses C++ 14. On your own computer, if you have a recent g++ compiler, you could use C++ 17 instead.

CMake Step 2
CMake requires that we name the project, so you should choose a name for the project and then add the following line to CMakeLists.txt:


project(<your_project_name>)
You can choose any name you want, but be sure to change <your_project_name> to the actual name of the project!


CMake Step 3
Next, we want to add an executable to this project. You can do that with the add_executable command by specifying the executable name, along with the locations of all the source files that you will need. CMake has the ability to automatically find source files in a directory, but for now, you can just specify each file needed:


add_executable(your_executable_name  path_to_file_1  path_to_file_2 ...)
Hint: The source files you need are the three .cpp files in the src/ directory. You can specify the path relative to the CMakeLists.txt

Example:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5.1)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)

project(MyFirstProject)

add_executable(first src/main.cpp src/increment_and_sum.cpp src/vect_add_one.cpp)
