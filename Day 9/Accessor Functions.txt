Accessor Functions
Accessor functions are public member functions that allow users to access an object's data, albeit indirectly.

const
Accessors should only retrieve data. They should not change the data stored in the object.

The main role of the const specifier in accessor methods is to protect member data. When you specify a member function as const, the compiler will prohibit that function from changing any of the object's member data.
